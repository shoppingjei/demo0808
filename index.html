    <p>New Delhi, India (CNN)On a winter's day in 1985, a one-time Indian prince was killed by police in a bustling Rajasthan market.
        For decades, the police officers on duty and the former royal's relatives couldn't agree on what had happened that day to a man known for his fiery nature and political ambition.
        Raja Man Singh's family -- part of a centuries-old royal lineage -- claimed he had been killed in a premeditated murder plot ordered by the highest politician in the state.
        But police said they opened fire in self-defense, killing a hot-tempered man who thought himself above the law.
        For 35 years, no one was held accountable for Man Singh's death. Then, last month, after a protracted legal battle, 11 policemen were convicted of his murder and sentenced to life in prison.

        Such fires are typically used to clear any remaining vegetation from parts of the forest that have already been cut down -- preparing the soil for illicit pasture planting and cattle raising. July's increase occurred despite a federal decree forbidding for 120 days fires for farming or other purposes in the Amazon and the tropical wetland area known as the Pantanal.
